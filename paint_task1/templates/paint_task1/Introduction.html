    <p>
        In Part 1 of the experiment, you will be asked to complete three tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Firstly, you will be shown five pairs of paintings by two artists. You will then be asked to choose which
        painting in each pair you prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the second task, everyone will again be shown five pairs of paintings, but these paintings are from <b> two other
        artists</b>. You will again be asked to choose which painting in each pair you prefer.

    </p>
    <p>
       You will then be assigned to one of three groups based on the artists you preferred in both tasks. These groups
        will be the same for the remainder of the experiment.

    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, you will complete a task with the members of your group. Depending on your groupâ€™s performance, you
        can earn up to 200 tokens in this task.
    </p>
    <p>
        After Part 1 has finished, we will give you the instructions for the next part of the experiment.
