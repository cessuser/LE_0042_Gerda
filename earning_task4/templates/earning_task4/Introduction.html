    <p>
        For the final part of todayâ€™s experiment, you are asked to complete three short tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, you will complete the Earnings Task from before. However, this time you will play <b>against the clock</b>.
        Your earned points will be directly converted into tokens. The number of tokens you earn thus depends solely
        on your own performance. The task will be the same for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondly, you will be asked to decide on a bonus for a randomly matched participant in the lab. The level of
        this bonus will be 200 tokens or 600 tokens. The computer will randomly select one participant from the lab
        session to receive the bonus that was chosen by their match. They will not know who chose the level of their
        bonus. The lottery outcome is revealed at the end of the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, you will be asked to complete a several survey questions.
        After the survey, you will find out your total payoff from the experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Earnings Task will start on the next screen.
